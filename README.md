This repository collects practical tools, code snippets, and AI-assisted prompts to support legal engineers, technical lawyers, and developers working at the intersection of law and code.

It helps analyze legal documents, automate contract review, and verify smart contract logic. It blends traditional contract structures with modern legaltech tools — including Python for automation and Solidity for smart contract prototyping.
